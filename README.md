A personal project / work manager for doing evidence based scheduling.

TWS is not meant for general use. 

In its present form it only supports one passwordless user. I  run it locally. 

The code is hosted here in the hopes that it will be a good example of the different components that make it work.

TWS is backed by 

- [bknr.datastore](https://github.com/hanshuebner/bknr-datastore) 
- [lazybones](https://github.com/cbeo/lazybones)
- [spinneret](https://github.com/ruricolist/spinneret)
- [LASS](https://github.com/Shinmera/LASS)
- and a dash of [parenscript](https://common-lisp.net/project/parenscript/)
